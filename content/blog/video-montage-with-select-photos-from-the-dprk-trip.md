I've resolved to not check email until noon at the earliest. This is
what happens when you take away the life sucking power of electronic
mail. As some of you know, I recently took a trip to the DPRK and was
able to do and see some amazing things. Including, playing the first
ever ultimate frisbee tournament in North Korea, going to see the Mass
Games, and seeing the DMZ from the other side.
