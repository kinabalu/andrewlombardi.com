I resolve to never stay too long in fear without
remembering a moment later, that I am an infinite being, that there is
good wherever I look if I’m willing to just look beyond. Beyond the rat
race, beyond the consistent effort to be less than our potential by the
masses. To be in servitude to anyone but your own source is to discount
how beautiful you are. To feel that you must be in service to an “out
there” is to discount your divinity. You may believe that God is outside
of you, or that you are just a microcosm of the infinity that is God.
Both are correct. To take a concept and it’s opposite and keep them
equally as valid in the mind is the dichotomy of our planet. To know
light, there must be it’s opposite. As humans we understand concepts by
comparing and contrasting them with others, until we arrive at a stable
enough thought to be considered a “thing”.

But that isn’t reality. You think that’s air you’re breathing?

Be not afraid of who you really are. Share your gift with the world no
matter how scary. Be presence.
