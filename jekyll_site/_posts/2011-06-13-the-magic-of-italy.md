*Domani e un'altro giorno!*

My son and I have been in Italy for over 3 weeks now.
We've ventured from the very North where you could throw a rock at
Switzerland, down to that ancient pocket in the center where the "[man
with the funny white hat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope)" calls home. We're having the time of our
lives, certainly one of the most treasured experiences of my life. I sit
here writing this while looking out over a Tuscan night sky, in a
farmhouse of all places, completely relaxed. We've both embraced, the
feeling of slow. It's not unique to Italy, but in many regions they've
mastered it.

**Especially here, in Tuscany.**

In Tuscany, the Italian Siesta is the norm, and literally built into the
schedules of most establishments. Don't expect much from anyone between
the hours of 12pm and 4pm. Nor on Sundays. And some places Monday isn't
going to net you much productivity either. Oh, and don't forget
holidays! Visiting from the outside, where a Siesta is unheard of, this
can be a shock. It certainly seemed that way for me, when I'm used to
being able to pop into any restaurant at home during "normal business
hours" and get service no matter what. I've visited with some folks
while in Italy who consider this unproductive, lazy, and downright rude.
I see things differently.

In every place we've been to thus far, our encounters with Italians have
been mostly in Italian (with hand gestures for easier understanding) and
broken and often times not adequate English. My son and I often look at
each other with confused stares when walking around parts of Italy,
inevitably, we'll be stopped and monologued with by an older Italian
gentleman. Sometimes I'll mutter off some apologetic words and pleas for
him to slow down "Piu piano", and I understand only a little "Scusa,
Capito poco Italiano". Other times we'll just smile, let him finish, say
"Grazie! Ciao!" and be on our way.

*"Dad, what was that guy saying?" "I have no idea" "Haha, he was a funny
guy"*

At every encounter though, as I've taken to do while at home in
California speaking Spanish, I attempt to get my point across in
Italian. Broken and often stressing the wrong parts of a word, but
definitely giving it the college attempt. And my Italian is getting
better. I ask a lot about the lack of English when I find Italians with
a better conversational fluency. Most blame the school system,
apparently reform in the last 10 years is finally bringing English
language learning as a requirement for Italy's young. Other opinions
have mostly slammed the Italian people for not adopting learning English
in such a tourist-heavy destination. *"Think of how much easier you
could make it on the tourists!"*, they would say. I see things
differently.

[pullquote]Get lost in the magic of a place. Invite me into your
culture, and let me feel it.[/pullquote]Being in Italy reminds me of the
story of [the fisherman and the businessman](http://paulocoelhoblog.com/2010/09/08/the-fisherman-and-the-businessman/). Essentially a
businessman comes upon a fisherman who is very skilled at the job of
fishing, catches enough fish to feed himself and his family for the day,
and then retires to play with his kids, relax, and drink at night with
his buddies, laugh and have a good time. The businessman in an attempt
to help this lazy sod explains how he could expand to a grand fishing
empire, make millions, command large fleets of fishing boats. With a
simple question of "And then what?". We essentially get to an experience
the fisherman is already enjoying.

Italy has a lot of fisherman, and a lot of businessmen. The siesta is
brilliant. It's the life of the fisherman in action. It's the choice
between eeking out a few extra hours of productivity in the middle of
the day, or taking a nap. In some spots it's simply too hot to do
anything productive anyway. We see the life of the businessman in most
of the tourists who visit the cities. They are very easy to spot. This
creature usually carries a camera glued to one hand, a headset in the
other, and moves very quickly in a large group. The leader of their
group is often an enterprising foreigner speaking the groups native
tongue, who holds up an unopened umbrella or other unique symbol, and is
rattling off facts about each destination they stop and swarm at. I
often wonder if they ever just sit and stare off into the centuries old
relics and enjoy being here, without filling a photo album with sign
posts of proof that "I was there."

Part of the magic of being in Italy, is hearing Italian, and
experiencing what it is to be here. If you came to Italy, and only heard
English spoken, would the place hold the same romance? Traveling with a
child has forced me to venture where most tourists usually don't, or
visit museums / monuments when lines are nearly nonexistent. I enjoy
hearing the Italian flow, even when I don't understand most of what's
being said, it helps me get lost in being here.

And isn't that the point? Get lost in the magic of a place. Invite me
into your culture, and let me feel it. My son and I certainly have
pictures of sites we've been (which include many playgrounds), and
videos as well, and through it all my focus for each day is to listen.
Listen to what I feel called to do for that day. And if the answer is to
play with my son at a playground or color dinosaurs on the steps of a
museum with a ton of amazing Boticelli paintings ready to be devoured...

I'll experience my time in Italy that way.
