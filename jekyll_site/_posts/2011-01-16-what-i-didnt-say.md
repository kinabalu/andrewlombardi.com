The memory of holding you has never faded. Singing to
you in a dimly lit room, unaware of our surroundings, just us two. It
lasted only brief moments but it was a lifetime that we shared. Though
short, it has broken open everything in my life. When I first heard of
your arrival, my soul was overjoyed, the happiness I felt inside was
boundless. Your first kicks of life brought about the wonder once
reserved for only childhood, back into my view. And with an instant that
I will always remember vividly, all was seemingly lost.

Since our time together was short, I’d like to go over some things I
didn’t get to say, but I know our eyes did:

-   Told you how beautiful you looked,
-   Said ‘peek-a-boo’ to get you to smile,
-   Told you how strong you were crawling and then walking
-   Said how stunning you looked before your prom
-   Told you to smile while I took a million pictures
-   Said how beautiful you were on your wedding day
-   Told you that he has your nose, and your lungs
-   Said goodbye as I drifted off for a long sleep

All was not lost on that day. I’ve been broken open many times after
that moment, but it has always been a furthering of what you and I
started together. And within a few short years your brother arrived and
several times over your gift has taught me to say what resides in my
heart.

I love you baby.
