Last week I decided that I didn't like dealing with Wordpress any longer.  It's a constant cat and mouse game to update the framework, then all the plugins, and pray that nothing breaks in the process.  And I'd rather post new photos, new articles, and not deal with it.

So I'm running a Python app called [Pelican][pelican] which is a static site generator along with [Dropbox][dropbox] and a few other assorted goodies.  I've set it up so I can even write from my iPad and everything will be golden.

Would this be a good option for a blogger sick of the pain that can be caused by a Wordpress install?  No.  Not without technical skill, or someone nearby who can help with the transition.
