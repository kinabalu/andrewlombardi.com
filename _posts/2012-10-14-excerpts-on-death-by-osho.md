Only at the moment of death do people recognize the fact that they have
not lived.

And when there was time to live, you were doing a thousand and one
foolish things, wasting your time rather than living it.

So I can suggest only one thing. Now you cannot go back to your past
death, but you can start doing one thing: Always be ready to move from
the known to the unknown, in anything, any experience. Just jump on
something that is new.... its very newness, its very freshness, is so
alluring. Then there is courage.

<!--more-->

It is better, even if the unknown proves worse than the known---that is
not the point.

Start by a simple exercise, and that is; always remember, whenever there
is a choice choose the unknown, the risky, the dangerous, the insecure,
and you will not be at a loss.

And only then -- this time death can become a tremendously revealing
experience.

Courage will come to you. Just start with a simple formula: never miss
the unknown. Always choose the unknown and go headlong. Even if you
suffer, it is worth it -- it always pays. You always come out of it more
grown up, more mature, more intelligent.

The Western man has been living under a very wrong conception. It has
created so much tension in people's minds that they are always on the
go, and they are always worried that one never knowns when the end is
coming. Before the end they want to do everything. But the result is
just the opposite; they cannot even manage to do a few things
gracefully, beautifully, perfectly. They cannot just sit silently for an
hour, because their mind is saying to them, "why are you wasting this
hour? You could have done this, you could have done that"

In the Western concept, death is the end of life. In the Eastern
concept, death is only a beautiful incident in the long procession of
life; there will be many, many deaths.

Guilt is not natural, it is created by religions. They have made every
man guilty -- guilty of a thousand and one things, so burdened with
guilt that they cannot sing, they cannot dance, they cannot enjoy
anything.
