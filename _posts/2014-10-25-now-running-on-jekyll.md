![jekyll_logo][]

So, obviously the conversion to Pelican didn't bring about a wealth of writing that I can point to as a success.  Truth be told, I was never quite fond of the look of the theme chosen, and perhaps the creativity started to wane from that point.  Or perhaps it's just laziness.  

No matter.  I've redone the [Mystic site][mystic] to use Jekyll, and I've done the same now for this one.  

Plans.
