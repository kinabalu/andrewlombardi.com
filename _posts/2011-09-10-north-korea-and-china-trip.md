A week ago I returned from a two-week trip to North Korea, and China.
The trip to the DPRK was scheduled, highly structured, and fully planned
out by a tour group. I added a few days on the beginning and end of the
trip to see some of what was in and around Beijing, China. Both
countries were fascinating, and had wonders to photograph and
experience.

Here are the many galleries I'd love to share with you:
