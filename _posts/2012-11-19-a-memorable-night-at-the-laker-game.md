[![Laker Score](http://andrew-lombardi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Photo-Nov-18-23-30-10.jpg)](http://www.nba.com/games/20121118/HOULAL/gameinfo.html)

The smiles I saw tonight were of pure elation and joy. I felt it
important for me to highlight our experience as I remember it.

The game was set to start at 6:30pm, and we had a 45 minute drive to get
there. You slept for more than half of the ride, and woke when we
finally got close enough to the parking for an attendant to speak into
the car directing us where to go.<!--more--> We donned our new Lakers
jerseys before walking into the STAPLES center. You had the look of
wonder and amazement, and no idea what any of it all meant. You were
hanging out with your dad, and that was enough.

I explained the rules, in broad strokes, and we sat and watched the
introduction of the players, the tip-off, and the game. Everyone that
night who met you, said you were the coolest kid. I watched with pride
as you handled yourself in this social situation, and gave you a nudge
when I felt you needed one. We watched as the score was 111 to 98,
Lakers were up, and you predicted they would get 119 in the end.

You stayed awake the entire ride home. Perhaps it was the peanut butter
cup cookie from the dessert cart, or it was so you could write up on my
whiteboard the final score. You were right. It ended the way you
predicted, and it was better than I could have imagined.
