![Going Offline](/images/blog/going_offline.jpg)

On more than one occasion, I've opened up a new tab in the frontmost browser and started typing. In the most unconscious way possible, I would start typing the first few letters of Facebook before catching myself, or not. Due to this constant realization, in October of last year I decided to make a change. I wouldn't post about quitting the social network, thus sealing in my faux moral superiority to the more than 1.2 billion commoners. Nor would I delete my account. I was just going to stop going.

It lasted for three months. The first two weeks were beyond difficult. Regularly I would catch myself opening up that distracted tab ready to get that rush of adrenaline learning about the useless drivel that exists on the social network. In that time period I learned that keeping the app on my phone and tablet was a recipe for disaster. I found delight in the separation of the messages app so I could technically still communicate with my extended network of virtual people.

I recently read a piece in the New Yorker titled [The Useless Agony of Going Offline](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-useless-agony-of-going-offline). In the first section of the article, he recounts what I can only assume is a normal day in his life.
